            <h2>2 Nephi 9:7</h2>
            <p> Wherefore, it must needs be an infinite atonementâ€”save it should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption. 
                Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man must needs have remained to an endless duration. 
                And if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more.</p>

            <h2>3 Nephi 27:8-11</h2>
            <p> 8 And how be it my church save it be called in my name?
                 For if a church be called in Moses name then it be Moses church; or if it be called in the name of a man then it be the church of a man; 
                 but if it be called in my name then it is my church, if it so be that they are built upon my gospel.

                9 Verily I say unto you, that ye are built upon my gospel; therefore ye shall call whatsoever things ye do call, in my name;
                 therefore if ye call upon the Father, for the church, if it be in my name the Father will hear you;
                
                10 And if it so be that the church is built upon my gospel then will the Father show forth his own works in it.
                
                11 But if it be not built upon my gospel, and is built upon the works of men, or upon the works of the devil, verily I say unto you they have joy in their works for 
                a season, and by and by the end cometh, and they are hewn down and cast into the fire, from whence there is no return.</p>
